# Design Document

## Overview

The inventory dashboard is a web-based application that provides real-time visibility into inventory levels, purchase orders, and warehouse distribution. The system will be built using a modern web stack with a RESTful API backend and a responsive frontend interface.

## Architecture

The system follows a three-tier architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Responsive web frontend with real-time updates
2. **Application Layer**: RESTful API with business logic and data aggregation
3. **Data Layer**: Relational database with optimized queries for dashboard performance

## Stock Replenishment Workflow

### Reorder Trigger Points

The system provides multiple entry points for initiating stock replenishment:

1. **Individual Product Reorder**:

   - "Reorder Stock" button on each product row in stock levels table
   - "Reorder Stock" button on each product row in products management page
   - Click-through from reorder suggestions component

2. **Bulk Product Reorder**:

   - Checkbox selection on stock levels table
   - Checkbox selection on products management page
   - "Reorder Selected" button for multiple products

3. **Proactive Suggestions**:
   - Reorder suggestions component on dashboard
   - Automated suggestions based on stock levels and usage trends

### Purchase Order Creation Modal Design

The purchase order creation modal follows a three-step wizard approach:

#### Step 1: Order Details

1. **Supplier Selection**:

   - Dropdown filtered to suppliers associated with selected products
   - If no supplier association exists, show all available suppliers
   - Display supplier contact information and reliability metrics
   - Show last order date and average delivery time

2. **Delivery Information**:

   - Expected delivery date picker with supplier average delivery time pre-filled
   - Warehouse destination selection (defaults to primary warehouse)
   - Order priority selection (Normal, Urgent, Critical)

3. **Order Notes**:
   - Free text field for special instructions
   - Pre-populated templates for common scenarios (reorder, emergency, etc.)

#### Step 2: Products Review

1. **Product List Display**:

   - Table showing selected products with current stock levels
   - Reorder point display for context
   - Suggested quantity calculation: (reorder_point Ã— 2) - current_stock
   - Editable quantity and unit price fields

2. **Quantity Suggestions**:

   - Smart suggestions based on reorder points and usage trends
   - Visual indicators for suggested vs. custom quantities
   - Bulk quantity adjustment options (increase all by %, set minimum order quantities)

3. **Pricing Information**:
   - Last purchase price display for reference
   - Unit price editing with validation
   - Real-time total calculation per product and order total

#### Step 3: Review and Confirmation

1. **Order Summary**:

   - Complete order details with supplier information
   - Product breakdown with quantities and pricing
   - Total cost calculation including any applicable taxes or fees
   - Estimated delivery date and warehouse destination

2. **Validation and Submission**:
   - Final validation of all required fields
   - Confirmation of order details
   - Submit button with loading state during creation
   - Success confirmation with order number

### Bulk Reorder Handling

When multiple products are selected for reordering:

1. **Supplier Grouping**:

   - Automatically group products by their primary suppliers
   - Create separate purchase orders for each supplier
   - Display supplier grouping in the modal for user confirmation

2. **Mixed Supplier Scenarios**:

   - Allow user to reassign products to different suppliers if needed
   - Show warning when products don't have associated suppliers
   - Provide option to split orders or assign all to one supplier

3. **Quantity Management**:
   - Apply bulk quantity adjustments across all selected products
   - Maintain individual product suggestions while allowing bulk modifications
   - Validate minimum order quantities per supplier

## Product Creation Workflow

### Form Design and User Experience

The product creation modal follows a structured approach to collect comprehensive product information:

#### Form Layout

1. **Modal Structure**:

   - Large modal (800px width) with scrollable content
   - Header with "Add New Product" title and close button
   - Form sections with clear visual separation
   - Footer with Cancel and Save buttons

2. **Form Sections**:

   - **Basic Information**: Name, SKU, Category, Description
   - **Pricing**: Cost Price, Sale Price
   - **Inventory Management**: Reorder Point, Per-warehouse stock levels
   - **Media**: Image URL with preview

3. **Warehouse Stock Section**:
   - Dynamic list of all active warehouses
   - Each warehouse shows: Name, Address, Quantity input field
   - Default quantity of 0 for all warehouses
   - Visual indicators for required vs optional stock setup

#### Validation Rules

1. **Required Field Validation**:

   - Name: 1-255 characters, no special characters except hyphens and spaces
   - SKU: 3-50 characters, alphanumeric with hyphens, must be unique
   - Category: Must be selected from predefined list
   - Cost Price: Positive decimal number, max 2 decimal places
   - Sale Price: Positive decimal number, max 2 decimal places, must be >= cost price
   - Reorder Point: Non-negative integer

2. **Optional Field Validation**:

   - Description: Max 1000 characters
   - Image URL: Valid URL format, optional preview validation
   - Warehouse Stock: Non-negative integers, defaults to 0

3. **Business Logic Validation**:
   - SKU uniqueness check via API call
   - Sale price must be greater than or equal to cost price
   - At least one warehouse must have stock > 0 (warning, not error)
   - Image URL accessibility check (optional)

#### Form Behavior

1. **Real-time Validation**:

   - Field validation on blur and form submission
   - SKU uniqueness check with 500ms debounce
   - Visual feedback with error messages below fields
   - Form submission disabled until all required fields are valid

2. **User Experience Features**:

   - Auto-focus on first field when modal opens
   - Tab navigation through all form fields
   - Escape key to close modal (with unsaved changes warning)
   - Loading states during SKU validation and form submission
   - Success message and automatic modal close on successful creation

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Field-level error messages with specific guidance
   - Form-level error summary for submission failures
   - Network error handling with retry options
   - Validation error persistence until resolved

### Backend Processing

1. **Product Creation Transaction**:

   - Create product record with basic information
   - Create inventory records for each warehouse with stock > 0
   - Calculate initial stock status based on reorder point
   - Update dashboard metrics and caches
   - Return complete product data with stock breakdown

2. **Data Integrity**:
   - Database transaction ensures all-or-nothing creation
   - SKU uniqueness enforced at database level
   - Audit trail for product creation events
   - Rollback mechanism for failed creations

## Error Handling

### Frontend Error Handling

- **Network Errors**: Display retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- **Data Loading**: Show skeleton loaders during API calls
- **Empty States**: Provide helpful messages when no data is available
- **Validation Errors**: Display inline validation messages

### Backend Error Handling

- **Database Connectivity**: Implement connection pooling and retry logic
- **API Rate Limiting**: Return appropriate HTTP status codes (429)
- **Data Validation**: Validate all input parameters and return structured error responses
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

### Error Response Format

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVENTORY_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "No inventory data found for the specified criteria",
    "details": {
      "location_id": 123,
      "timestamp": "2024-12-08T10:30:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```
